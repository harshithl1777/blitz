# Blitz

### Description

Taking attendance is one of the most time consuming and complicated things in school. For starters, teachers have read through the whole list of students in the class which takes up a lot of time, especially for 1-hour classes. Also, on days when substitute teachers are present, it's not uncommon to have the a few students cringe when their name gets butchered. That's where Blitz comes in.

### How it works

With Blitz, taking attendance would look like this:
1. The teacher starts a new **attendance session** for their appropriate class and receives a 6-digit code.
2. Students can then navigate to tryblitz.vercel.app/students(tryblitz.vercel.app/students) and enter this same code.
3. After filling two fields (full name and student ID), the student will be marked as present.
4. These attendance records will start showing up on the teacher's side of the app in **realtime**.
5. All the attendance records will then be saved to a history tab after the attendance session ends for the teacher's reference.
